# GUI component for Tuffa timmen - Results

A RESTful master-detail application built using Angular 2 and [ngrx store](https://github.com/ngrx/store).

## Prerequisites
You will need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js + NPM](http://nodejs.org) installed on your machine. You will also need to install the `typings` NPM package globally via `npm i -g typings`.
> Even if you already have the `typings` package installed globally, this repo requires `typings 1.x` so make sure your version is up do date.

## Getting Started
There are two main parts to this application. The first is the server for which we are using `json-server` to simulate a REST api. The second part is the Angular 2 application which we will use `webpack-dev-server` to build and display.  

To get started, run the commands below.

```
# Download the code
$ git clone https://github.com/berkar/tt-resultat.git
$ cd tt-resultat

# Install dependencies
$ npm i

# Install typescript definitions
$ typings install

# Build the app
$ npm start
```
Then navigate to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser.
